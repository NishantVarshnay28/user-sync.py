# This is a sample configuration file for the Adobe-Console connector.
#
# umapi (user management api) is a network protocol served by Adobe that
# provides management of users in Adobe-hosted enterprise organizations.
#
# This sample file contains all of the settable options for this protocol.
# All of the settings here can be changed.  It is recommended
# that you make a copy of this file and edit that to match your configuration.
# While you are at it, you will likely want to remove a lot of this  commentary,
# in order to enhance the readability of your file.

authentication_method: oauth

# (optional) UMAPI server settings (defaults as shown)
# The host and endpoint settings specify the Adobe endpoints which
# host the UMAPI services and those which provide authorization.
# The timeout and retries settings control how much delay (in seconds)
# can be tolerated in server responses, and also how many times a request
# that fails due to server timeout or server throttling will be retried.
# You will *never* need to alter these settings unless you are provided
# alternate values by Adobe as part of a support engagement.  It is
# highly recommended that you leave these values commented out
# so that the default values are guaranteed to be used.
server:
  #host: usermanagement.adobe.io
  #endpoint: /v2/usermanagement
  #auth_host: ims-na1.adobelogin.com
  #auth_endpoint: /ims/exchange/jwt
  #timeout: 120
  #retries: 3

# (required) integration settings
# You must specify all five of these settings.  Consult the
# Adobe UMAPI documentation and the Adobe I/O Console to determine
# the correct settings for your enterprise organization.
integration:
  org_id: "Org ID goes here"
  client_id: "Client ID goes here"
  client_secret: "Client secret goes here"

  # (optional) You can store credentials in the operating system credential store
  # (Windows Credential Manager, Mac Keychain, Linux Freedesktop Secret Service
  # or KWallet - these will be built into the Linux distribution).
  # To use this feature, uncomment the following entries and remove the
  #client_id, and client_secret above.
  # The actual credential values are placed in the credential store with the
  # username as the org_id value, and the key name (perhaps called internet
  # or network address) as one of the values below.
  #secure_client_id_key: umapi_client_id
  #secure_client_secret_key: umapi_client_secret

# (optional) identity_type_filter (default value is all)
# By default, connector will automatically load users from all identity type to be load as directory users.
# When specify with one of the following value (adobeID, enterpriseID, federatedID)
# the connector will automatically filter users by the specified identity type.
identity_type_filter: all
